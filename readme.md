# Case Study: Roman Numerals

## Learning Competencies

- read and understand unfamiliar code
- recognize recurring patterns in code
- demonstrate familiarity with ruby syntax
- execute and verify the performance of code against a strict specification
- build endurance for confusion and uncertainty
- demonstrate ability to engage in meaningful debate regarding code
- develop an awareness for performance implications and maintanance costs
- demonstrate the ability to create and execute a plan to build a software solution
- develop an appreciation for deeper study and sharing learning outcomes

## Summary

This case study is intended to melt your brain a little.  Be patient with yourself, get wildly curious about what's going on and don't stop til you drop.

You may want to try solving the original challenge first.  This will help shape the holes in your head for the round, square and other odd-shaped pegs you'll find during this case study.

*Also note at the bottom of this gist there may be a statement like "X other files aren't shown".  This is a limitation of this github interface.  To see all the files just download (or clone) this gist to get access to all the files in this case study.*

## Releases

Take an hour (or three) and read through all the code on this page carefully.  Run some (or all) of it to make sure you understand how it works.

Take notes while you do, it'll help, believe me.

Make sure you understand how each person solved the problem.

### Release 0

**establishing a baseline**
- does every solution run?  how can you verify this?
- do any solutions have bugs?  how can you verify this?

**breaking new ground**
- did you see any new syntax you didn't recognize?  any new operators, expressions or methods?
- can you decipher the syntax yourself from the context?
- will you use this new syntax in your next project?
- any new data structures?  what are they?

### Release 1

**recognizing patterns**
- how many fundamental solution patterns did you find?
- how do you recognize them?  are you sure?  get worked up about it.

**working with patterns**
- what can you learn from these different perspectives?  are they really different?  if so, why?  debate.  get worked up about it.
- if you had to choose one, which one is the 'best' and why?  discuss with your pair if you have one.

### Release 2

**considering optimizations**

consider the patterns you noticed in the code ...
- what are the performance implications of these patterns?  how can you verify this?
- what are the maintenance implications of these patterns?  how can you be sure?

### Release 3

**beginner's mind**
now that you've gone through all the above, open up a blank file and start again.
- what are you thinking about now?   as you plan your attack, what's most important?  as you consider options, what's least important?
- do you feel more or less confident than you did at first about your goal and ability to achieve it?  what's different?  discuss.
- does knowing so much about how others solved this challenge constrain your thinking?  if so, how can you reverse this effect?

## Optimize Your Learning

- document (and get ready to share) your aha! moments during this experience.
- find a new pair-of-pairs to discuss your findings.  debate.  get worked up about it.
- find a teacher or coach and ask them to review your work.  debate.  get worked up about it.
- write a blog post about what you've done here today.  now that you care so much, share it.
